## 1. Executive Summary
La Marquise is a well-established culinary destination in the upscale Bonapriso neighborhood. It operates a dual-concept space: a **Fast-Food** section for casual dining (burgers, pizza) and a **Restaurant** section for fine dining (French/Italian fusion, local specialties). Despite its high reputational standing (#47 of 204 restaurants on TripAdvisor) and strong social media following, it lacks a dedicated website to capture direct reservations, showcase its full menu professionally, or automate orders.

## 3. The Digital Gap (Opportunity Analysis)

| Channel | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Website** | ❌ **MISSING** | **Critical Gap.** No central hub for menu, brand story, or SEO. |

## 4. Customer Voice (Review Insights)
*   **Strengths:**
    *   "Outstanding food and staff."
    *   "Culinary gem... inviting ambiance."
    *   Diverse menu catering to both fast food and fine dining lovers.
    *   Outdoor seating is a major draw.
*   **Pain Points (Solvable by Tech):**
    *   **Service Speed:** Reviews suggest service can be slow during peak hours. *Solution: QR Code ordering at tables.*
    *   **Menu Accessibility:** finding the full menu requires scrolling through Facebook photos. *Solution: Mobile-responsive digital menu.*

## 5. Strategic Sales Pitch
**Hook:** "Turn your Facebook traffic into direct revenue."

**The Problem:**
"You have a fantastic reputation in Bonapriso, but you are 'renting' your audience from Facebook. If a customer searches 'best pasta Bonapriso' on Google, they find TripAdvisor, not *you*. Plus, taking reservations by phone during rush hour slows down your staff."

**The Solution (Feature Set):**
1.  **Official Brand Website (`lamarquise.cm`):** A premium digital storefront that matches your chic decor.
2.  **Digital Menu & Ordering:** A searchable, mobile-friendly menu. Allow customers to browse before they arrive (speeds up table turnover).
3.  **Event Booking Portal:** A dedicated page for private events/parties (high-margin revenue).
4.  **QR Code Integration:** Place QR codes on patio tables for instant menu access, reducing waiter workload.

## 6. Website Strategy: "The Lead Magnet"
The goal is not just a brochure site, but a **Revenue Engine** designed to capture data and fill seats.

### 6.1 Phase 1: Capture & Convert (The "Reservation" Funnel)
*   **Hero Section:** High-impact video background of the "Saturday Night Vibe" with a prominent "BOOK A TABLE" button (sticky on mobile).
*   **The "VIP List" Pop-up:** "Join our VIP list for exclusive event invites and a free appetizer on your birthday." (Builds an email/SMS list for retargeting).
*   **Direct WhatsApp Floating Button:** "Chat with the Manager" for instant group booking inquiries.

### 6.2 Phase 2: Operational Efficiency (The "Ordering" Funnel)
*   **QR Code Table Ordering:**
    *   **Scenario:** Patio is busy. Customer scans QR code -> Views Full Menu with Photos -> Selects Items -> Waiter receives pre-order on tablet.
    *   **Benefit:** Increases average order value (visuals sell better than text) and reduces waiter "back-and-forth."
*   **Digital Menu Engineering:**
    *   Highlight "High Margin" items (Cocktails, Chef's Specials) at the top of the mobile view.
    *   Filter by "Fast Food" vs. "Fine Dining" to guide the user journey instantly.

### 6.3 Phase 3: High-Value Lead Generation (Private Events)
*   **"Plan Your Event" Landing Page:**
    *   A dedicated form for birthdays, corporate dinners, and weddings.
    *   **Fields:** Date, Guest Count, Budget Range, Special Requests.
    *   **Automation:** Form submission triggers an auto-reply email with a "Private Dining Brochure" (PDF) and alerts the manager via SMS.

**Closing Question:**
"Would you be open to a 10-minute demo showing how a digital reservation system could save your team 5 hours a week?"
